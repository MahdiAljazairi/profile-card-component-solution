## My Process

### Hardest Part

Choosing meaningful class names. It's harder than you think!

### What I Learned

You can do math inside a `clamp()`. Wow.

## Tools

- [Dev Docs](https://devdocs.io) - The resource I was referring to throughout the process. It's an offline web app that has a huge collection of documentations.
- [Brackets](https://brackets.io) - My text editor. Not as powerful as VS Code, but still my favorite.
- Chrome - This web page was only tested on Chrome.
